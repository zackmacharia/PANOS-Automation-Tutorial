# PANOS-Automation-Tutorial

This repo will contain code that's intended to give you guidance on how to interact with the Palo Alto Networks API. The repo will also contain code that I've used to operationalize the firewall and/or panorama.


This repo will show how to use the [pan-os-python](https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/panpython_qs/) and [pan-golang](https://panos.pan.dev/docs/apis/pango_qs) packages

PALO-AUTOMATION-PYTHON contains the PAN Python SDK aka pan-os-python examples

PALO-AUTOMATION-GOLANG contains the PAN Go aka pango examples
